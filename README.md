![AI Tutor API Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tech-in-Schools-Initiative/aitutor-api-saas-starter/main/public/logo-long.png)
 
Use workflows and chatbots created with [AI Tutor API](https://aitutor-api.vercel.app/).  
This template is based on [Vercel SAAS Starter](https://github.com/nextjs/saas-starter). 

## Overview

The **AI Tutor API Subscription Starter** is your complete starting point to build SaaS applications that integrate AI workflows and chatbots powered by AI Tutor API. This template leverages the powerful foundation of Vercel SAAS Starter and extends it with Stripe-based subscription management, PostgreSQL (using Drizzle ORM), and per‑month message tracking with limits based on subscription tiers.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (experimental App Router)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, powered by [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- **Payments:** Stripe (integrated with Stripe CLI for local testing)
- **AI Service:** [AI Tutor API](https://aitutor-api.vercel.app/)
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication stored in cookies
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui and custom components
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-tutor-api-saas-starter.git
   cd ai-tutor-api-saas-starter
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup:**

   - Copy the example environment file and rename it to `.env`:

     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

   - Update the following keys in your `.env` file:
     - `POSTGRES_URL` – Your database URL.
     - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` – Your Stripe secret key.
     - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` – Your Stripe webhook secret.
     - `BASE_URL` – Your application’s base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
     - `AUTH_SECRET` – A secret key for JWT signing (e.g. generated with `openssl rand -base64 32`).
     - `AITUTOR_API_KEY` – Your API key for AI Tutor API.
     - `WORKFLOW_ID` – The workflow ID used by the AI Tutor API.
     - `CHATBOT_ID` (optional) – Your chatbot ID.
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AITUTOR_TOKEN` – The public token for AI Tutor interactions.

4. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The app will then be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

5. **Migrate and seed the database:**

   ```bash
   pnpm run db:generate
   pnpm run db:migrate

   ```


## Configuration & Setup

### Stripe Setup

1. **Install Stripe CLI:**  
   Follow the [Stripe CLI installation guide](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) if not already installed.

2. **Authenticate Stripe CLI:**  
   Run `stripe login` and follow the instructions.

3. **Set Up Products and Prices:**  
   In your Stripe Dashboard, create your products and corresponding prices for your subscription tiers. Then edit the file `lib/tiers.ts` with the proper details for each tier.

### Tiers & Message Limits

The available tiers are defined in **lib/tiers.ts**:

- **Free:**
  - Price: `null` (no payment required)
  - Description: For individuals who need to track their work.
  - Message Limit: **5 messages per month**
  - `productId`: *empty* (indicates the free plan)
  
- **Starter:**
  - Price: `$10/month`
  - Description: For small teams with basic collaboration needs.
  - Message Limit: **100 messages per month**
  - `productId`: *Set to your Starter tier Stripe product ID*

- **Pro:**
  - Price: `$30/month`
  - Description: For large teams needing advanced features.
  - Message Limit: **Unlimited** (represented as `-1`)
  - `productId`: *Set to your Pro tier Stripe product ID*
  
**How Message Limits are Enforced:**

- When a workflow runs, the API route (e.g., `/api/run/route.ts`) checks the current team's message count:
  - If the team has an active Stripe subscription (i.e. its `stripeSubscriptionId` is set) and its `stripeProductId` matches one of the tiers' `productId`, then the message limit for that tier is enforced.
  - Otherwise, the team is considered to be on the free plan with a limit of 5 messages per month.
- Each time a workflow is triggered, one message credit is consumed and the team's `currentMessages` count is incremented.

## Workflow and Chatbot Integration

### Workflow Page
The workflow page provides an interface for users to interact with AI Tutor API workflows:

- **Input Submission**: Users can enter prompts (e.g., "Tell me a content about a magical forest") and generate AI-powered responses.
  
- **Message Limit Enforcement**: When a workflow is executed, the backend checks the team's message limit. If the limit is reached (e.g., for free users, 5 messages per month), the workflow is blocked and an error is returned.

- **Workflow History**: 
  - All workflow interactions are automatically saved to the database
  - Users can access their workflow history by clicking the history icon in the input field
  - The history drawer displays past prompts and their results, sorted by most recent
  - Clicking on any history item will restore both the input prompt and the generated output
  - History is shared among team members, allowing for collaborative work
  
### Chatbot Page
Build and test chatbots created with AI Tutor API as part of your SaaS application:

- **Embedded Chatbots**: Easily embed chatbots created with AI Tutor API
- **Real-time Streaming**: Experience real-time text streaming for a more interactive chat experience
- **Customizable Interface**: The chat interface can be styled to match your application's design

### Extending Chat History to the Chatbot Page

The chatbot page can be enhanced with a message history feature similar to the workflow history:

#### Implementation Guide

1. **Database Schema**: 
   - The existing `workflow_history` table can be used as a model
   - Create a `chat_history` table with fields for:
     - `id`: Unique identifier
     - `teamId`: Team association
     - `userId`: User who initiated the chat
     - `messages`: JSON array of chat messages (or individual message rows)
     - `createdAt`: Timestamp
     - `title`: Optional auto-generated title based on conversation content

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - Create `/api/chat/history` endpoint to fetch chat history
   - Modify the existing `/api/chat` endpoint to save conversations
   - Add an endpoint to allow users to name or categorize conversations

3. **UI Components**:
   - Add a history drawer component similar to `WorkflowHistoryDrawer`
   - Implement a chat session selector to switch between conversations
   - Add options to continue previous conversations or start new ones


## Sidebar Subscription Status Display

The sidebar features a dedicated component that displays:
- The **Subscription Tier Badge:**  
  Displays the full tier name when expanded or just the first letter when collapsed. If no active subscription exists, "Free" is shown.
  
- The **Messages Left Badge:**  
  Shows “Messages: X left” (or just the number when collapsed). If the tier provides unlimited messages, it displays “Unlimited” or an infinity symbol (∞). Additionally, the badge is styled green when remaining messages are available and red when the limit is reached.

This display automatically updates (using a polling mechanism) to reflect usage without requiring a page refresh.

## Database Setup & Seeding

Ensure the database schema includes:
- The teams table with `messageLimit` and `currentMessages` columns.
- Correct associations for users, team members, activity logs, invitations, and messages as defined in **lib/db/schema.ts**.
  
Run the seed script using:
  
```bash
pnpm db:seed
```

This creates a default user and team, initializing the free plan appropriately.

## Running in Production

Before deployment:
- Update your environment variables accordingly.
- Test your Stripe integration (webhooks, portal sessions, etc.).
- Verify that your database and subscription tiers are properly configured.
